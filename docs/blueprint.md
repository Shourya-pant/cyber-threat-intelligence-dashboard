## Style Guidelines:

- Dark background (#0B0D17) to create a modern, cyber-security aesthetic. The dark mode improves readability and reduces eye strain during prolonged use.
- Primary color: Vibrant gradient red (#red) to highlight key interactive elements, progress indicators, and important data visualizations.
- Accent color: Neon green (#2ECC71) as an accent to draw attention to real-time alerts, critical indicators, and active controls. Use this to signify important changes or interactive areas.
- Use a clean, sans-serif font for optimal readability. The font should support a variety of weights to differentiate between headings, subheadings, and body text.
- Employ a set of minimalist icons for the sidebar menu, search filters, and user settings. Icons should be consistent in style and use neon green as the highlight color on hover.
- Design a modular card layout for threat details to present information in an organized format. Cards should have interactive hover effects to display extended information dynamically.
- Implement smooth, subtle animations for page transitions, menu interactions, and data updates. Animations should enhance user engagement without being distracting.
